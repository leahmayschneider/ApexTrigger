ApexTrigger
===========

Bypasses account creation for Salesforce contacct creation.
For certain businesses, individuals are contacted instead of companies.  Therefore it's inefficient to create an account.
This trigger automatically makes an account called (contact's name) Individual when a custom field (Individual checkbox) is checked and moves the contact to the account.
Salesforce accounts aren't affected and all processes are standard and easy to use.
